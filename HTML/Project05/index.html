    Oh, so you&#39;re a programmer now, huh?
  </h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to programming, the most lucrative career in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Being a programmer means you have now opened up a whole new world of endless possibilities.  Instead of simply being a passive user of technology, you are now a creator.  You can create your own websites, social networks, mobile apps, and even games.  You have the ability to create systems and environments that can reach potentially millions of people online.  No other time in human history has such a thing been possible.  We are truly living in the future, my friend, and I am happy to have you a part of it.

<h3>
We serve the most delicious food you'll ever find!

<p>
Established in 2002, The Breakfast Restaurant is a contemporary cafe that appeals even to the pickest of eaters (that means you)!  Whether you want eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, cereal or just a regular cup of coffee, we've got it all.  
</p>

<p>
We are passionate about excellence, and we have a desire to serve you with a consistent quality that you won't find anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
We want you to feel at home.  You can expect to feel a level of comfort and warmth from our nicely decorated dining area.  We have comfortable chairs, old-fashioned wooden tables, and other wonderful aspects that are simply unmatched anywhere else.  We even have a patio area for our guests who need a little sunshine in their lives.
